		<h1 id="About">What is Pauper?</h1>
		<p>Pauper is an Online Sanctioned Magic the Gathering
			format. It was officially established in 2005 by Alex Ullman and his
			colleagues, and has been one of the more popular formats in the game.
			A pauper deck can consist of any common throughout the history of the
			game, provided that it is not on the banned list. The format has
			constantly evolved over the years, and is enjoyed by many player both
			online and in paper. I have been playing this format on and off for
			several years now, and I really enjoy the format.</p>

		<!-- this discusses the reasoning behind the bans -->
		<p>The following cards have been banned from the pauper format.
			Cards like Grapeshot, Empty the Warrens, and Temporal Fissure allow
			for some rather powerful storm win conditions, that can kill as early
			as turn 1. Things such as Peregrine Drake, Frantic Search, and Cloud
			of Faeries have allowed for infinite mana combo's to be prevalent.
			Invigorate caused strategies like infect to become dominant and too
			fast for the format to hand. CloudPost warped the late game, decks,
			and treasure cruise caused blue decks to become format warping.
			Cranial Plating was banned at the inception of the format, for being
			a mistake in card design, and too powerful of a card. All of these
			cards have earned their place on the ban list.</p>

		<h1 id="Lists">Deck Lists</h1>
		<p>One cool aspect of Pauper is that there are a variety of
			strategies in the format. This section will cover the two most
			powerful archetypes in the format currently, and give a general
			outlook to it.</p>

		  <p>The Delver deck aims to use tempo to win most of its games. It uses early 
		  selection like ponder and preordain to find the cards it needs, along with 
		  things such as spellstutter to counter the opponent's spells. Eventually, it will
		  resolve the card Ninja of the Deep Hours and take over the game from there.

			<h2>Boros Monarch</h2>
			
			<p>Creatures</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Kor Skyfisher</li>
				<li>4 Glint Hawk</li>
				<li>4 Palace Sentinels</li>
				<li>4 Thraben Inspector</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Instants</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Lightning Bolt</li>
				<li>4 Galvanic Blast</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Sorcery</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 Battle Screech</li>
				<li>2 Firebolt</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Artifact / Enchantment</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Prophetic Prism</li>
				<li>4 Alchemist's Vial</li>
				<li>2 Journey to Nowhere</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Lands</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Ancient Den</li>
				<li>4 Great Furnace</li>
				<li>4 Boros Garrison</li>
				<li>4 Mountain</li>
				<li>4 Plains</li>
				<li>2 Radiant Fountain</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<p>The Boros decks aims to slowly grind out the opponent in a midrange fashion.
		   This deck uses cards like glint hawk along with kor skyfisher to bounce 
		   cards that net value and slowly take over the board. Having cards like 
		   Palace Sentinels allows this deck to 1 for 1 the opponent while slowly getting
		   ahead on cards, eventually taking full control over the game.

		<!--this discusses my experience in the pauper format-->
		<h1 id="Experience">My Experience</h1>
		<p>I have been playing the Pauper format for several years now. I
			enjoy the complexity of the format, as well as how affordable it is
			compared to other formats in the game. Having all the cards be of
			common rarity means that the games are much more grindy, and as a
			result the games go long. The deck that I am currently piloting is
			Inside Out Combo. This deck aims to combo out the opponent using the
			card Tireless Tribe, along with Inside out. Here is a picture of my
			cards for the deck.</p>
